//  RotaryCraft Custom Extract Loader 
// -------------------------------
// 
// Use this file to add custom ores and extracts to the extractor.
// Specify one per line, and format them as 'Name, Rarity, Product Type, Product Ore Name, Color 1, Color 2, OreDictionary Name(s)'
// 
// Ore rarity is the rarity of the ore blocks in the world, and affects the multiplication rates.
// Valid Rarity Values:
// 	EVERYWHERE - Large and very common veins, like Copper and Fluorite
// 	COMMON - Larger sized and common veins, like Tin and Redstone
// 	AVERAGE - Average sized veins of average rarity, like Iron
// 	SCATTERED - Average sized but rarer veins, like Gold and Calcite
// 	SCARCE - Veins are smaller and often hard to find, like Lapis and Diamond
// 	RARE - Generally a single block or two per chunk, like Emerald and Platinum
// 
// Valid Product Types:
// 	Ingot - Ingots like Iron and Copper
// 	Dust - Dusts like Redstone and Sulfur
// 	Gem - Gems like Diamonds and Amethyst
// 	Item - Anything else, like ThaumCraft shards
// 
// Capitalization for the ore dictionary names matters, but is ignored for rarities and types.
// Ensure your OreDict names are correct; not all mods follow the 'oreName' and 'productName' convention.
// 
// Colors must be hex codes; try to avoid conflicts with existing ores, including those natively handled by RC.
// 
// Sample Lines:
// 	Sample Ore 1, SCARCE, INGOT, ingotSample, 0xffffff, 0x73cc12, oreSample
// 	Sample Ore 2, Common, dust, dustMetal, 0x77003b, 0xb1a700, oreNotSample, oreSecondName, oreHasLotsOfVariants
// 	Sample Ore 3, EVerYwHEre, gEm, ImproperIngot, 0x1487a6, 0x27c61a, PoorlyNamedOre
// 
// Entries missing names, rarities, types, products, or colors, or having less than one Ore Dictionary name, are incorrect.
// Incorrectly formatted lines will be ignored and will log an error in the console.
// Lines beginning with '//' are comments and will be ignored, as will empty lines. Spaces are stripped.
// 
// NOTE WELL: It is your responsibility to choose the ore blocks appropriately.
// 	While you can theoretically make anything processable in the Extractor,
// 	null or missing blocks, and non-blocks are likely to crash and corrupt the
// 	world. You may also create duplication exploits. No support will be provided in this case.
