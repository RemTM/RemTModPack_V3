# GregTech's several machines work in mysterious ways for me, I've added support for them but I'm not quite sure how any of the machines work. Please report any unintended behaviour # 
# inputs and outputs are ItemStacks (represented thus: itemName, size, meta), anything else is a value (integer only, no commas allowed!) #

# Guide: #
# fusion = aInput1, aInput2, aOutput1, aDuration, aEUt, aSpecialValue #
# centrifuge = aInput1, aInput2, aOutput1, aOutput2, aOutput3, aOutput4, aDuration #
# electrolyzer = aInput1, aInput2, aOutput1, aOutput2, aOutput3, aOutput4, aDuration, aEUt #
# lathe = aInput1, aOutput1, aOutput2, aDuration, aEUt #
# cutter = aInput1, aDuration, aOutput1, aEUt #
# sawmill = aInput1, aInput2, aOutput1, aOutput2, aOutput3 #
# grinder = aInput1, aInput2, aOutput1, aOutput2, aOutput3, aOutput4 #
# distillation = aInput1, aCellAmount, aOutput1, aOutput2, aOutput3, aOutput4, aDuration, aEUt #

# wiremill = aInput1, aEUt, aDuration, aOutput1 #
# bender = aEUt, aDuration, aInput1, aOutput1 #
# extruder = aEUt, aDuration, aInput1, aShape, aOutput1 #
# assembler = aInput1, aEUt, aInput2, aDuration, aOutput1 #
# alloySmelter = aInput1, aInput2, aEUt, aDuration, aOutput1 #
# canner = aInput1, aEUt, aInput2, aDuration, aOutput1, aOutput2 #
# vacuum = aInput1, aOutput1, aDuration #
# chemical = aInput1, aInput2, aOutput1, aDuration #
#
# Say we want to add a recipe to the canner. It would look like this: #
# canner=potato,1,0, 300, carrot,1,0, 20, apple,1,0, bread,1,0 #
# If we compare that to the guide above we'll see that we've just created a recipe for the canner with 1 potato and 1 carrot as inputs, 300 as the EU input, 20 duration and 1 apple and 1 bread as outputs #
