RemTModPack V3
==============

A modpack currently in development for Minecraft 1.7. Unlike previous versions of RemTModPacks, this modpack will be developed completely independently from any Feed The Beast modpack.

How to install:
===============
1. Unlike previous versions of the modpack, you will now need to download MultiMC seperately. This is to ensure everyone can obtain a copy of MultiMC which is compatible with whatever OS you are currently running. MultiMC can be downloaded here: http://multimc.org/
2. Once MultiMC is downloaded, install the files anywhere you wish. Once installed, locate the "instances" folder where MultiMC was installed at.
3. Download the .zip of the modpack, which can be found on the right side of the Github website this modpack is available from.
4. Extract the contents of the .zip file into the "instances" folder you previously found, ensuring that the files are in a folder labeled "RemTModPack_V3".
5. Launch the MultiMC application, then in the window that pops up, double-click on the "RemTModPack V3.x.x" instance. If required, simply let MultiMC download the relevant files. You should now be able to play the modpack. Enjoy!

Server Rules:
=============

Rule #1
NO GRIEFING OF ANY KIND (direct or indirect) is allowed on the server which will cause damage to another player's "property". This includes but is not limited to bases, items, owned mobs, etc. Exceptions to this rule will include proper compensation for any "damages" incurred.

Rule #2
While killing another player directly is not permitted, indirect death is permitted as long as it does not break the 1st rule. Indirect death means that your player name must not show up as having killed another player. You will be penalised if this rule is broken.

Rule #3
Any dropped items from players due to death indirectly caused by another player must be made available to the killed player whenever possible, otherwise it will be breaking the 1st rule.

Note:
The rules above can be ignored if 2 or more players agree to "battle it out". The winner is free to take any items a player drops when defeated. The "battle arena" must be agreed upon by all players involved.

Rule #4
The creation of any books or portals to any of the various dimensions (Nether, Twilight, Deep Dark, any Mystcraft Book/Portal, etc.) without first unlocking the portal "To The Surface" is forbidden unless prior approval from the Ops or Admin is provided, or you have "unlocked" the ability to do so from completed quests. Usage of another player's book/portal to access a dimension you have yet to unlock access to is also forbidden.

Rule #5
If you are allowed to create a book/portal to any dimension as stated by either any completed quest or op/admin permission provided to the player, you must never under any circumstances allow other players to use the book/portal to access other dimensions that player has not yet unlocked access to.

Rule #6
Aiding of other players in any fashion is allowed, as long as it does not conflict with the 4th and 5th rules. Players are encouraged to trade resources fairly, but will not be enforced. Players may also team up with other players if they so wish.

If any of the rules are broken with no clear reason as to why it was broken, the player who broke the rule(s) will be punished. The decision and severity of the punishment will be decided by the server admin, as well as any appointed server Ops, while taking into account any opinions voiced by any other players involved.

Note: These server rules may be changed at any time. An update will be released on all related sites if this is to occur.
